This is my GNU https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs[Emacs^] configuration.

== Installation

NOTE: Only tested on Emacs version 25+.

The configuration is maintained using https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el[straight.el^] for package management and https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package[use-package^] for package initialization and configuration.

Everything is self-contained in `init.el` and other elisp files. The package manager is _bootstraped_ if needed. Simply clone and launch emacs:

[source,shell]
----
mv -v ~/.emacs.d{,.old}
git clone https://github.com/kode9/conf-emacs.git ~/.emacs.d
emacs --debug-init &
----

CAUTION: The first start might take some time as dependencies are cloned and built.

== External dependencies

The configuration provides integration of external tools:

* https://git-scm.com/[Git^] with https://magit.vc/[Magit^]
* https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher[AG the silver searcher^] with https://github.com/Wilfred/ag.el[ag.el^]
* A spell checker such as http://aspell.net/[Aspell^] or https://hunspell.github.io/[Hunspell^] for the https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Spelling.html[built-in spell checker^] and https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/[Flycheck^]

== Customization

Type `kbd:[M-x] customize-group kbd:[RET] abz kbd:[RET]` to see available custom variables.
